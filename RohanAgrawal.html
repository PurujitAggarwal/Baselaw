      <h3 class="heading font-x2">Rohan Agrawal</h3>
      <p>Rohan Agrawal is an associate lawyer with close to 8 years of experience in the legal field. Currently, he is working in a law chamber, Chetan Kapadia - Advocate, he has spent the previous 7 years working at different law firms including MDP & Partners.</p>
      <p>Having first gained an interest in law around the age of 15, when he attended a court hearing, Mr. Agrawal studied Commerce but decided to attend K.C. College for Law after this as he was still interested in the profession. </p>
      <p>Mr. Agrawalâ€™s day-to-day work includes going to court over matters. As a counsel, Mr. Agrawal is not heavily involved in talking to clients and is only presented with matters to argue in court by law firms. </p>
      <p>Mr. Agrawal suggests that any aspiring lawyer must master the art of patience. A lot of time is required to understand the legal matter, prepare documents and learn the necessary skills to become a better lawyer. This becomes even more prominent in a country such as India where it can take many years for any legal matter to be resolved.</p>
      <p>Mr. Agrawal also thinks that any successful lawyer must have the ability to read and understand books and laws very fast along with being able to use these laws in arguments properly in court. This is not a skill that comes naturally to many, but with constant, dedicated effort, it can be learnt.</p>
