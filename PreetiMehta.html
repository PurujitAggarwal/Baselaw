      <h3 class="heading font-x2">Preeti Mehta</h3>
      <p>Preeti Mehta is a senior partner at Kanga and Co. Advocates & Solicitors with 38 years of experience in the legal field. She has spent about 35 years at Kanga and Co. which is one of the oldest and best law firms in India. </p>
      <p>Ms. Mehta was exposed to law from a very young age as her father was a prominent lawyer himself, who specialised in corporate laws, litigations and arbitrations including international arbitrations. </p>
      <p>Ms. Mehta decided to join the Government Law College to study law, even though she had an interest in many other subjects earlier. After having had an early exposure to corporate law, litigation, arbitration and real estate, Ms. Mehta opted to specialise in corporate & commercial laws with focus on M&A, private equity, banking and franchising. </p>
      <p>Ms. Mehta spent the majority of her career in representing clients in various M&A and private equity transactions, including drafting and negotiating complex documents and, involving frequent domestic and international travel. Nowadays, given her experience and expertise, she prefers to delegate that work to her juniors, while supervising and overseeing and when required being involved in critical parts of a matter. </p>
      <p>Ms. Mehta suggests that any aspiring lawyer must understand and know their own skill set. They must also explore and understand all the different types of legal areas of practice to see which one appeals to them the most. In Ms. Mehtaâ€™s opinion, the ideal situation is for any aspiring lawyer to get at least some amount of exposure and experience in most of the legal fields.</p>
      <p>Ms. Mehta also believes that aspiring lawyers must know the laws well as in any matter, different laws would be applicable. It is therefore important to keep oneself updated with the changes and judicial interpretations, especially those that are crucial to their field. A lawyer must also have good command over English language and deliver high-quality work. A lawyer must also be easily reachable and give sound advice in a quick turnaround time as this would always benefit the client and the lawyer. Above all, great emphasis must always be laid on character, integrity, ethics and fair play.</p>
