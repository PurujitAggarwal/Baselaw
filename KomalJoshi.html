      <h3 class="heading font-x2">Komal Joshi</h3>
      <p>Komal Joshi is a Partner at ALMT Legal, a top law firm in India. Interestingly, it was founded in the UK. She has almost 20 years of experience as a litigator.</p>
      <p>Ms. Joshi started her academic journey by studying Commerce but found that her heart lay with the law and has never looked back since. Her alma mater is K.C. College.</p>
      <p>Ms. Joshi is a litigator with a broad focus, having argued a plethora of both civil and criminal cases. On a day to day basis, Ms. Joshiâ€™s job involves her going to court, drafting documents along with speaking to clients.  </p>
      <p>Ms. Joshi's first piece of advice to any aspiring lawyer is that you must know which country you want to practice law in. Along with this, she also advises all students to partake in internships at law firms to understand what lawyers do daily and see whether it would be a good fit for them. </p>
      <p>In terms of skill sets, Ms. Joshi believes that anybody aspiring to be a highly successful litigator must master the art of patience as a lot of time goes into talking to a client and understanding their issue. Along with this, a litigator must be able to read a lot and act on their feet as many times there is an issue which comes up and must be tended to without any prior notice.</p>
